# 💸 Budget Overrun Detection App

This project is a **Streamlit application** for detecting and analyzing **budget overruns** in projects using either synthetic or uploaded CSV data.  
It predicts whether a project will overrun its budget and assigns a **risk score** indicating the likelihood of an overrun.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload your own project data** or use **synthetic sample data**.
- **Visualize** Estimated Budget vs Actual Spending.
- **Detect Budget Overruns** automatically.
- **Predict Overrun Risk Scores** (0–100%).
- **Download prediction results** as a CSV file.
- **Clean, modern UI** with metrics and interactive charts.
- **Built using** Streamlit, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

📥 Sample CSV Format

If you want to upload your own data, ensure your CSV includes the following columns:
Column Name	Description
Estimated_Budget	Estimated total project budget (numeric)
Actual_Spent	Actual total amount spent on the project
Project_Type	(Optional) Type of project (e.g., IT, Construction)
Duration_Months	(Optional) Project duration in months
🌟 Future Improvements

    Upload and compare multiple project datasets

    Feature importance analysis (which factors drive overruns)

    Deploy live to Streamlit Cloud

    Add notification for high-risk projects

# 🧹 Additional Notes:
- If you want, I can also generate a **LICENSE** file (MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL) so it’s fully open-source!
- You can replace `[Your Name or Team Name]` with your real name.
- If you later deploy to **Streamlit Cloud**, you can add a **Demo Link** section!

Would you like me to also generate:
✅ A **sample CSV (`sample_data.csv`)** ready for upload  
✅ A **LICENSE file** (MIT recommended)  
✅ A **Streamlit Cloud deployment guide**  

Which one should I create next? 🎯  
(just say: "sample csv", "license", or "cloud deployment") 🚀
